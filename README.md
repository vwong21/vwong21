# üí´ About Me:
I am a Software Developer with 3+ years of experience in building, testing, and deploying web applications. I have helped companies deliver high-performance applications, increasing operational efficiency and enhancing user experience, resulting in improved business outcomes

Some examples include:

- As a software developer at PlaceSpeak, I worked in a development team to build a program that leverages AI for data analysis and transforms the datasets into human-eadable formats, improving decision-making for municipal officials

- At Innota.ai, I worked as a software developer in a team to develop new features for the note-taking application. I implemented AI to summarize and mutate notes and refactored the front-end logic to streamline further development

I am excited about opportunities to collaborate with others, sharing my knowledge to help them improve while also learning from their experiences to enhance my own skills

I love connecting with new people, you can reach me at vincentwong5609@gmail.com
